# SNHU CS255 Final Project Repo

# Project Summary:
  This project was a mock request from a client seeking to create a superior driver education platform. The request involved designing the web-based learning platform that would be used to host learning materials, allow students to take practice exams, track progress, and schedule in-person instruction sessions. 
  
# Where I think I exceled and how I can improve:
  Over the course of this term, I have come to greatly enjoy all forms of diagramming in the design process and am satisfied  with the work I have done in this aspect of design. At this point, I believe that despite my occasional lapses in formal notation I have done well in conveying clean and concise diagrams that would be useful as future documentation. I have a while to go on my class diagrams, as I feel I confused some concepts/notations, but I hold thorough documentation throughout the design process in high regard and will continue to work on this weakness. As someone with a small bit of (semi)professional software design experience, I have had my fair bit of experience with poor documentation and how much it can hold back progress.
  
# The importance of considering user needs:
  When designing any commercial product, user consideration is arguably the most important factor to ensure some level of success. Any product that fails to capture user needs has no room in crowded markets such as driver education, therefore designing such products should hone in on what users want that is not being provided. In this instance, the company wants to capture an audience by providing a greater level of flexibility to students through online lessons and in-vehicle lessons at times/locations designated by the student.
  
# My approach to software design:
  I tend to approach design in an iterative manner. In my opinion, initial designs should encapsulate the core features that are either necessary for functionality or designated by a client. A functional product is the ultimate goal, and any quality of life features can be added at a later date once they have been adequately designed, developed, and tested. As previously mentioned, I am also an advocate of thorough documentation at the initiation of any project and believe that neglecting proper planning at the start will lead to aimless development.
